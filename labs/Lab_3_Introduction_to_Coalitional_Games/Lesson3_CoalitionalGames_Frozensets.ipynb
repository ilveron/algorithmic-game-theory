        "In this notebook, we will explore how to use computation to explore and solve coalitional games.\n",
        "Coalitional games, also known as Transferable Utility (TU) games, are a particular class of games where the payoff is not given to a single player but to a group (coalition) of players.\n",
        "\n",
        "Utility is *transferable* if one player can transfer part of their utility to another player, without loss. Such transfers are possible if the players have a common currency that is valued equally by all the players. It's important to note that we are still talking about utility. So, for instance, being able to transfer cash payoffs does not imply that *utility* is transferable: wealthy and poor players may derive a different utility from the same amount of money.\n",
        "\n",
